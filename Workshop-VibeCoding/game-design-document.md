Game Idea
Title: Zen Port: Color Flow A minimalist puzzle game where you manage a high-speed terminal. Instead of messy traffic, it focuses on the beauty of "perfect sorting"—turning a chaotic parking lot into a flowing stream of matching colors.

Short Game Concept
The Feeling: A mix of calm focus and the satisfying "click" of things fitting perfectly. The Fantasy: You are the AI Controller of a futuristic transport hub. What the Player Does: You tap cars to send them to a docking bay; you must pick the right colors to match the waiting travelers before your dock runs out of space.

One-shot Prompt (The "Architect" Prompt)
Role: You are a Senior Game Designer specializing in "Minimalist Logic Puzzles." Your mindset is focused on "Clarity over Complexity."

The Project: Build a single-file web game (HTML/CSS/JS) titled "Zen Port: Color Flow."

The Direction: > Create a grid of colored blocks (Cars) and a "Docking Area" (5 slots). The UI must be incredibly clean to prevent decision fatigue.

Logic: Players must clear the grid by matching car colors to the current passenger requirement.

The Constraint: If the Docking Area fills up, the flow stops (Game Over).

The Aesthetic: Use soft pastel colors, smooth transitions, and a "dark mode" background.

Goal: Deliver a polished, bug-free prototype where the mechanics feel "snappy" and the win/loss states are crystal clear without using long tutorials.

1. Core Feeling
Order from Chaos: The relief of clearing a crowded space.
Flow: The rhythmic tapping of matching colors.

2. Game Fantasy
The Hub Master: You aren't just parking cars; you are directing the pulse of a city. You make sure everyone gets where they need to go.

3. Target Players
People who feel overwhelmed by complex apps.
Casual players who enjoy "sorting" and "organizing" activities.
Anyone needing a 2-minute mental "reset."

4. Core Loop Idea
Look: Check the passenger's color.
Find: Identify that color in the lot.
Clear: Tap to move the car. If it matches, the path clears.
Win: Empty the lot.

5. Why This Game Should Exist
Modern life is cluttered. This game provides a safe, small space where the player can achieve "100% completion" and perfect order in just a few minutes. It solves the problem of information overload by giving the player one clear goal at a time.
