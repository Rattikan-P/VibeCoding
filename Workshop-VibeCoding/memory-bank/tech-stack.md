# Tech Stack - Zen Port: Color Flow

---

## Core Technology

**Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Single-file web application

---

## Design Philosophy

**Keep it simple, no frameworks.**

---

## Technology Choices

### HTML
- Semantic structure for game layout
- Grid-based parking lot rendering

### CSS
- Dark mode background
- Soft pastel color palette for cars
- Smooth transitions for all interactions
- Minimalist, clean interface to prevent decision fatigue

### JavaScript
- Pure vanilla JS - no frameworks, no libraries
- State-based rendering system
- 2D Array for grid representation
- Event-driven interaction model

## Architecture Principles

- **Single-file architecture**: Everything in one file for simplicity
- **No build step**: Direct browser execution
- **No dependencies**: Zero external libraries
- **Maximum compatibility**: Runs in any modern browser

## Why This Stack?

The project prioritizes:
1. **Simplicity**: No setup required, no build tools
2. **Accessibility**: Easy to read, modify, and understand
3. **Performance**: Lightweight, instant loading
4. **Focus**: Code clarity over framework sophistication

The goal is a "vibe coding" experience where the code itself feels calm and readable, matching the game's zen aesthetic.
