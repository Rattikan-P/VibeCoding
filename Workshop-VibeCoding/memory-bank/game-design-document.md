# Game Design Document - Zen Port: Color Flow

---

## Core Feeling

**Order from Chaos**: The relief of clearing a crowded space.

**Flow**: The rhythmic tapping of matching colors.

---

## Game Fantasy

**The Hub Master**: You aren't just parking cars; you are directing the pulse of a city. You make sure everyone gets where they need to go.

---

## Target Players

- People who feel overwhelmed by complex apps
- Casual players who enjoy "sorting" and "organizing" activities
- Anyone needing a 2-minute mental "reset"

## Player Experience

### Core Loop
1. **Look**: Check the passenger's color
2. **Find**: Identify that color in the lot
3. **Clear**: Tap to move the car. If it matches, the path clears
4. **Win**: Empty the lot

### Why This Game Should Exist
Modern life is cluttered. This game provides a safe, small space where the player can achieve "100% completion" and perfect order in just a few minutes. It solves the problem of information overload by giving the player one clear goal at a time.

### Desired Emotional Response
- **Calm Focus**: Mental clarity through simple, clear objectives
- **Spatial Relief**: Satisfaction from organizing chaotic space
- **The "Click"**: Perfect match moments that feel satisfying
